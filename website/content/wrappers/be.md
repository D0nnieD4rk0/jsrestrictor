The `navigator.sendBeacon()` method asynchronously sends a small
amount of data over HTTP to a web server. It is intended to be
used for sending analytics data to a web server. For more details
see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API and
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon

`navigator.sendBeacon` is the only method currently defined for the
Beacon API.
