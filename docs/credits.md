# Developpers

[Libor Polčák](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~polcak) was behind an idea to implement a webextension that works as a firewall for JavaScript APIs. He is the current main maintainer. He supervised/supervises diploma theses that improves the web extension.

Zbyněk Červinka developped a [proof-of-concept version](https://github.com/cervinka-zbynek/masters-thesis) of this extension as a part of his [master's thesis](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/DP/DP.php?id=21274) (in Czech).

Martin Timko is currently working on his diploma theses that aims to make the webextension public. He is the one who prepared the first public version and ported the extension to Chrome and Opera.

# Key ideas

The development of this extension is influenced by the paper [JavaScript Zero: Real JavaScript and Zero Side-Channel Attacks](https://misc0110.net/web/files/jszero.pdf). It appeared during the work of Zbyněk Červinka and provided basically the same approach to restrict APIs as was at the time developped by Zbyněk Červinka.
