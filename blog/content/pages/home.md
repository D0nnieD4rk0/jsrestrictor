        <p>JavaScript Shield adds a
        safety layer that allows the user to choose if a certain action should
        be forbidden on a site, or if it should be allowed with restrictions,
        such as reducing the precision of geolocation to the city area. This
        layer can also aid as a countermeasure against attacks targeting the
        browser, operating system or hardware levels.</p>
